# Description
An NGO, [Observatorio del Derecho a la Vivienda][observatorio-web] was
trying to get the cadastre data of MÃ©xico City, but [SEDUVI][seduvi-map]
(the corresponding goverment organization) doesn't have an API to access
this public information.

This repository includes a script to query their database.
